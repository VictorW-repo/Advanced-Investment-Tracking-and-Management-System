  Our project simulates Stock Market Paper Trading. The interface shows 
  the user what they would see if they were actually reading for the stock 
  market. The user can search for stocks, get the price, invest, and sell.
  The user will be able to see their stock history, net gain and loss, and
  investments and balance.
