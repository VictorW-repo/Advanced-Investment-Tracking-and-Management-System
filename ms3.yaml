  Our project simulates Stock Market Paper Trading. The interface shows 
  the user what they would see if they were actually reading for the stock 
  market. When running, a GUI will open allowing a user to create a new account
  or login to their existing one. From there, new users will be granted $10,000
  of fake money to invest. Users have the ability to go to the stock page where
  they can search the price of difference stocks as well as invest and sell
  them. The user can also go to the dashboard page where they can see the stock
  market indices, their own investments, net gain/loss, and balance.
